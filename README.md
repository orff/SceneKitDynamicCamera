# SceneKitDynamicCamera

An attempt to adjust camera for varying level sizes or device rotation on any screen size. ( "Best Fit" )

I took the biolerPlate SceneKit scene, then with help from Apple forum members attempted to create some methods to correctly adjust the camera if the level size changed or the device was rotated.

Test this on different sized screens, orientations.

Tap on the box to get a new random box ( your levels ).
